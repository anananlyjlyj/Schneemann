Project of my Bachelor thesis using GIZMO. 

## Resources
[Documentaion of GIZMO](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO_files/gizmo_documentation.html) 

[Read output file of GIZMO](https://bitbucket.org/awetzel/gizmo_analysis/src/master/): Python package for reading and analyzing Gizmo simulations.

## Useful Tools
[diskpy](https://github.com/ibackus/diskpy): a python package for generating, analyzing, and managing NBody simulations of protoplanetary disks (PPDs)

[N-GenIC](https://www.h-its.org/2014/11/05/ngenic-code/): an initial conditions code for cosmological structure formation that can be used to set-up random N-body realizations of Gaussian random fields with a prescribed power spectrum in a homogeneously sampled periodic box; used for GADGET

[WVTICs](https://github.com/jdonnert/WVTICs): Generate glass-like initial conditions for SPH; Relaxation of the particle distribution is done using al algorithm based on Weighted Voronoi Tesselations (Diehl et al. 2012)
